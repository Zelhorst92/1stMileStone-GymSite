# FitLife. **The** gym to get in shape!

![FitLife Website Mockup](https://github.com/Zelhorst92/FitLife/blob/master/wireframes/website-multi-mockup.png "FitLife Website Mockup")

Welcome to the FitLife gym! **The** place to get in shape and live a Fit Life!
Located on a unique location in Dublin, this is the gym for you!

The website will offer the user the what, why and where about the gym in one scrollable page, with the intention to motivate the user to sign-up to the gym.
All the images on the site are used as eye catchers aswell as informing the user as what the user would be doing at the FitLife gym.

Thank you for visiting this project! For any feedback and/or questions you can always contact me via GitHub!

## Design Choices
The goal of this site is the entice people to register on this site to become a member at the FitLife gym.
Therefore the user should have the basic information at a glance and the colours should be of a positive 'feeling'.

### The structure
For the structure of the website I will use the framework [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ "Link to bootstrap").
This framework allows for a proper responsive website which is build up from a mobile-first perspective.
The grid-system that Bootstrap provides is very usefull to have a well working responsive website.
Furthermore Bootstrap has a wide browser compatibility, is quite easy to use and is very customizable.

### Fonts
As the site is intended to inform the user quickly and efficiently about the FitLife gym, the font has to be easy to read and not diverting attention to much from the goal of the user subscribing to the gym.
Therefore a simple but well readable font is necessary.
I will be using a font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts"), specifically the [Ubuntu Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu/ "Ubuntu Font").
As it is nice to the eyes and good to read. While still looking professional.

### Icons
Several icons will be needed, partially to make the user experience on the mobile phone more fluently and partially because it is the norm to represent links to social media such as facebook and twitter by their logo.
I will be using [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome") for this, as Font Awesome provides all the necessary icons and more.

### Colours
The colours should be positive, helping the site owners goal of getting as many subscriptions to the FitLife gym as possible.
However it should also not be too distracting from the information given.
Therefore a positive colour pallette is needed, but still pragmatical.
On the basis of the chosen hero image and the website [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/), I have arrived at the following colour [pallette](https://coolors.co/e74f0d-fb8d2c-b3b3b3-191919-3e3e3e).

![Colour Pallette Scheme](https://github.com/Zelhorst92/FitLife/blob/master/wireframes/colour-pallette-fitlife-gym.png?raw=true "Colour Pallette Scheme")
* #B3B3B3 "Silver Chalice" Will be the background colour.
Its neutral and all other colours will be distinctable.
* #E74F0D "Flame Orange" Will be used for what needs the attention of the user.
Such as the sign-up buttons or subscribtion prices.
* #191919 "Eerie Black" Will be used as the primary colour for the text.
* #3E3E3E "Onyx" Will be used as the secondary colour, possible for text if the primary colour will not fit or border just the make a distinction between different elements.
* #FB8D2C "Cadmium Orange" Will be used where the other colours cannot be used.
Ie if the Flame Orange is already being used nearby, but the element needs to stand appart.

#### Coolors Contrast Checker
Text versus background contrast is very important.
Therefore I have used the [contrast checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/) on Coolors.
The most important result is the basic background versus the text colour, which scored an [8.39](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/191919-b3b3b3).

## Wireframes
I have made wireframes for the sizes Mobile, Tablet and Desktop.
As per Bootstrap order, from small to large. To make the wireframes I have used the program [Balsamig Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Link to Balsamig Wireframes").
* [Mobile Wireframe](/wireframes/mobile-wireframe-index.png)
* [Tablet Wireframe](/wireframes/tablet-wireframe-index.png)

# Features
## Existing Features
### The Navigation Bar
The navigationbar is a component from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ "Bootstrap"), which I have modified to fit better with the style of the site.
It will stay at the top of the website at all time, so that the user can use it to navigate the website at the users descretion.
Furthermore is the navigationbar responsive and will show a menu button, with a dropdown menu when clicked, when viewed on a small tablet or mobilephone.
Upon click on a link in the dropdown menu, the menu will collapse back, so that the site is fully viewable again.

### The Hero Image/Hero Sign-up
The hero image is meant as an eye catcher; it is clear what the site is about.
This is combined with a big 'Sign-up' button to get the user to the sign-up section of the site to subscribe the gym.
The image resizes in such a way that there always exercising people in view.
The 'Sign-up' button links to furtherdown the website, where you can commit your contact details.

### The About Section
The about section contains 4 reasons why you should exercise, combined with an image of a member exercising.
The responsiveness is done with the grid layout from Bootstrap.
On the smaller screen sizes all content will be ordered vertically in one column; 2 paragraphs followed by the image and then followed by the other 2 paragraphs.
When the screen gets wider, paragraphs 2 and 4 will jump up to set next to paragraphs 1 and 3, with the image sitting in between the two sets of paragraphs, still aligned vertically.
When the screen gets even wider, paragraphs 2 and 4 will jump back below paragraphs 1 and 3, but the content will be aligned horizontally.
From left the right; paragraphs 1 and 2, then the image and then paragraphs 3 and 4.
All content is responsive and will resize accordingly to the screensize.

### The Review Section
The review section contains 2 reviews of members of the FitLife gym.
This is also made responsive with Bootstrap. On the smaller screen sizes, the reviews will be shown below each other.
When the screen gets wide enough they will be shown next to each other.

### The Subscription Section
In the subscription section, there are three different **subscription cards** to indicate the three options of membership; monthly, per season or yearly.
There is a small eyecatcher to the yearly subscription card, which blinks.
The select button brings you to the sign up section of the page.

### The Sign-up Section
The sign up section also has an eye catching background, to confirm once again that if you do your exercise at the FitLife gym, you will look great.
It also contains the sign-up form, where the user can leave their contact information so that the customerservice of the FitLife gym can contact the user with a membership offer they cannot refuse.
It requires the users full name, emailaddress and phonenumber plus their preffered subscription term. ~~In current stage the form will submit to a 'correctly submitted form checker' supplied by the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ "Code Institute") in one of the lessons.~~
In current stage, there is a modal that will poppup when the form is correctly filled in and submitted.

### The Gallery Preview Section
The gallery section contains images of people working out at the FitLife gym.
On this page it is meant as a preview, with only a few images.
The gallery is responsive to the screen of the user, done with the grid functionality from Bootstrap.
On the smaller screen sizes, three images will be shown, all below one another.
When the screen size increases, four images will be shown in 2 rows, both containing 2 images. When the screen gets even wider, three images will be shown all in one row.
First three, then four and at most five. That depends on the width of the screen.
It also contains the preliminary button to the non-existent dedicated gallery page.

### The Contact Section
The contact section contains the location, phonenumber and emailaddress of the FitLife gym.

### A modal on succesfully submitting the sign-up form
With the explanation and a snippet of JavaScript from [Simen Daehlin](https://github.com/Eventyret "githubpage of Simen") I have implementened a modal on submitting the form correctly.
The poppup says that the sign up was successfull and that the costumer service will contact the user for final approval.
It also wishes the user a **good day**.

## Future Features
### A dedicated gallery page
As much more could be shown about the FitLife gym, but not to make the homepage too crowded, a dedicated gallery page could be made.
This would require a change in the navigation bar and to the button on the gallery section of the homepage.

### A memberpage
As a member of the FitLife gym, the user would like to see what their current subscription is and possibly an option to enroll in one of the groupcourses.
This would need to be specific to each user and requires a login in functionality.
As this is beyond my current knowledge it cannot be implemented now, but it would be a future feature that should be implemented.

### A function that an email will be send to the subscriber when subscribing
Currently when you submit the form, it will go to a 'correctly submitted form checker' of the code institute.
That ofcourse should be sent to an email address or database of the FitLife gym so that the costumer service can contact the user.
Also the user should receive a copy of the submitted details as an email, possibly with an estimate on when they will be contacted.

### ~~A modal on succesfully submitting the sign-up form~~
~~Instead of going to the website of the Code Institute to see if the form successfully submitted, a modal should poppup to confirm that the form is correctly submitted.
As my knowledge of java script is very vague at best at this moment, this is on the list of future features.~~
This has become a current feature.


### A function where the user can completely subscribe to the FitLife gym, without the inbetween of a customerservice
Even better would be that the user can sign-up and complete registration at the FitLife gym on site without the need for contact with the customerservice.
This would require payment options, databases, security while doing the payment and probably steps I can not think of as of now.
This is also beyond my current knowledge and can therefore not be implemented now.
But it would be a must have feature, as it would cut the presure on the customerservice quite a bit and therefore cost.

# Credits
## Overall
I have looked at several websites of gyms and sports for initial inspiration: 
*   [FitForFree](https://www.fitforfree.nl/ "Link to sport site FitForFree")
*   [BasicFit](https://www.basic-fit.com/nl-nl "Link to sport site BasicFit")
*   [Westwood](https://westwood.ie/ "Link to sport site Westwood")
All three have a different approach and I tried to stand apart from them aswell.

## Content
The information on the About-section is roughly based on these articles: [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-benefits-of-exercise#TOC_TITLE_HDR_2 "Healthline.com")  and [Psychologytoday](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201205/18-reasons-exercise "Psychologytoday.com").
That combined with my own and common knowledge.

## Images
All the images present on this website are from [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/ "Unsplash.com") and [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/ "Pexels.com").
Both sites have collections of free to use images and a lot of them are of a very good quality.

### Useful links
*   [W3schools](https://www.w3.org/ "Link to W3schools")
*   [Stackoverflow Forums](https://stackoverflow.com/ "Link to stackoverflow")
*   [Makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/ "makeareadme.com")
*   [Markdown Cheatcheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet "Link to a Markdown cheatsheet")

## Code
### Overall
The lessons from the Code Institute, the site W3schools and the Stackoverflow forums were of great help in explaining in how certain code should work.

### Navigation
The navigationbar is a component from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ "Link to bootstrap") and the accompanying code snippet of JavaScript is made by my mentor, [Simen Daehlin](https://github.com/Eventyret "githubpage of Simen").
So that the dropdown menu of the navigationbar does not obstruct the view of the website on smaller devices.

### Form
The code in the sign-up form is roughly based on the form of the 'Love Running' course of Code Institute, although heavily modified.
The modal upon successfully filling out the form comes from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ "Link to bootstrap") and the accompanying code snippet of JavaScript is made by my mentor, [Simen Daehlin](https://github.com/Eventyret "githubpage of Simen").

# Thanks
#### My mentor
I would like to thank my mentor [Simen Daehlin](https://github.com/Eventyret "githubpage of Simen") for pointing me in the right direction in terms of the goals of the site.
He also gave me quite a couple of pointers on how to improve my code and the order of code.
I am certain that this will make me a more professional coder in the long run.
During the meetings accompanying this project he was very helpful and made clear what the actual scope of the project was.

#### My family and friends
I would also like to thank my family and friends for their brutally honest feedback which helped a lot to view the website from the users perspective.
They did not shy away from pointing out any flaws that I had overlooked. They were very helpful in the initial bouncing of ideas.
