## Design Choices

The goal of this site is the entice people to register on this site to become a member at the FitLife gym. Therefore the user should have the basic information at a glance and the colours should be of a positive 'feeling'.

### The structure

For the structure of the website I will use the framework [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ "Link to bootstrap"). This framework allows for a proper responsive website which is build up from a mobile-first perspective. The grid-system that Bootstrap provides is very usefull to have a well working responsive website. Furthermore Bootstrap has a wide browser compatibility, is quite easy to use and is very customizable.

### Fonts

As the site is intended to inform the user quickly and efficiently about the FitLife gym, the font has to be easy to read and not diverting attention to much from the goal of the user subscribing to the gym. Therefore a simple but well readable font is necessary. I will be using a font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts"), specifically the [Ubuntu Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu/ "Ubuntu Font"). As it is a nice to the eyes and good to read. While still looking professional.

### Icons

Several icons will be needed, partially to make the user experience on the mobile phone more fluently and partially because it is the norm to represent links to social media such as facebook and twitter by their logo. I will be using [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome") for this, as Font Awesome provides all the necessary icons and more.

### Colours

The colours should be positive, helping the site owners goal of getting as many subscriptions to the FitLife gym as possible. However it should also not be too distracting from the information given. Therefore a positive colour pallette is needed, but still pragmatical; not a distraction. On the basis of the chosen hero image and the website [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/), I have arrived at the following colour [pallette](https://coolors.co/e74f0d-fb8d2c-b3b3b3-191919-3e3e3e).

![Colour Pallette Scheme](https://github.com/Zelhorst92/FitLife/blob/master/wireframes/colour-pallette-fitlife-gym.png?raw=true "Colour Pallette Scheme")

* #B3B3B3 "Silver Chalice" Will be the background colour. Its neutral and all other colours will be distinctable.
* #E74F0D "Flame Orange" Will be used for what needs the attention of the user. Such as the sign-up buttons or subscribtion prices.
* #191919 "Eerie Black" Will be used as the primary colour for the text.
* #3E3E3E "Onyx" Will be used as the secondary colour, possible for text if the primary colour will not fit or border just the make a distinction between different elements.
* #FB8D2C "Cadmium Orange" Will be used where the other colours cannot be used. Ie if the Flame Orange is already being used nearby, but the element needs to stand appart.

#### Coolors Contrast Checker

Text versus background contrast is very important. Therefore I have used the [contrast checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/) on Coolors.
The most important result is the basic background versus the text colour, which scored an [8.39](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/191919-b3b3b3).

## Wireframes

I have made wireframes for the sizes Mobile, Tablet and Desktop. As per Bootstrap order, from small to large. To make the wireframes I have used the program <a href="https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/">Balsamig Wireframes</a>.

# Features

## Existing Features

### The Navigation Bar

The navigationbar is a component from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ "Bootstrap"), which I have modified to fit better with the style of the site. It will stay at the top of the website at all time, so that the user can use it to navigate the website at the users descretion. Furthermore is the navigationbar responsive and will show a menu button, with a dropdown menu when clicked, when viewed on a small tablet or mobilephone.

### The Hero Image/Hero Sign-up

The hero image is meant as an eye catcher; it is clear what the site is about. This is combined with a big 'Sign-up' button to get user to sign up to the gym. The image resizes in such a way that there always exercising people in view. The 'Sign-up' button links to furtherdown the website, where you can commit your contact details.

### The About Section

The about section contains 4 reasons why you should exercise, combined with an image of a member exercising. The responsiveness is done with the grid layout from Bootstrap. On the smaller screen sizes all content will be ordered vertically in one column; 2 paragraphs followed by the image and then followed by the other 2 paragraphs. When the screen gets wider, paragraphs 2 and 4 will jump up to set next to paragraphs 1 and 3, with the image sitting in between the two sets of paragraphs, still aligned vertically. When the screen gets even wider, paragraphs 2 and 4 will jump back below paragraphs 1 and 3, but the content will be aligned horizontally. From left the right; paragraphs 1 and 2, then the image and then paragraphs 3 and 4. All content is responsive and will resize accordingly.

### The Review Section

The review section contains 2 reviews of members of the FitLife gym. This is also made responsive with Bootstrap. On the smaller screen sizes, the reviews will be shown below each other. When the screen gets wide enough they will be shown next to each other.

### The Subscription Section

In the subscription section, there are three different 'subscription cards' to indicate the three options of membership; monthly, per season or yearly. There is a small eyecatcher to the yearly subscription card, which blinks. The select button brings you to the sign up section of the page.

### The Sign-up Section

The sign up section also has an eye catching background, to confirm once again that if you do your exercise at the FitLife gym, you will look great. It also contains the sign-up form, where the user can leave their contact information so that the customerservice of the FitLife gym can contact the user with a membership offer they cannot refuse. It requires the users full name, emailaddress and phonenumber plus their preffered subscription term. In current stage the form will submit to a 'correctly submitted form checker' supplied by the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ "Code Institute") in one of the lessons.

### The Gallery Preview Section

The gallery section contains images of people working out at the FitLife gym. On this page it is meant as a preview, with only a few images. The gallery is responsive to the screen of the user, done with the grid functionality from Bootstrap. On the smaller screen sizes, three images will be shown, all below one another. When the screen size increases, four images will be shown in 2 rows, both containing 2 images. When the screen gets even wider, three images will be shown all in one row. First three, then four and at most five. That depends on the width of the screen. It also contains the preliminary button to the non-existent dedicated gallery page.

### The Contact Section

The contact section contains the location, phonenumber and emailaddress of the FitLife gym.

## Future Features

### A dedicated gallery page

As much more could be shown about the FitLife gym, but not to make the homepage too crowded, a dedicated gallery page could be made. This would require a change in the navigation bar and to the button on the gallery section of the homepage.

### A memberpage

As a member of the FitLife gym, the user would like to see what their current subscription is and possibly an option to enroll in one of the groupcourses. This would need to be specific to each user and requires a login in functionality. As this is beyond my current knowledge it cannot be implemented now, but it would be a future feature that should be implemented.

### A function that an email will be send to the subscriber when subscribing

Currently when you submit the form, it will go to a 'correctly submitted form checker' of the code institute. That ofcourse should be sent to an email address or database of the FitLife gym so that the costumerservice can contact the user. Also the user should receive a copy of the submitted details as an email, possibly with an estimate on when they will be contacted.

### A modal on succesfully submitting the sign-up form

Instead of going to the website of the Code Institute to see if the form successfully submitted, a modal should poppup to confirm that the form is correctly submitted. As my knowledge of java script is very vague at best at this moment, this is on the list of future features. 

### A function where the user can completely subscribe to the FitLife gym, without the inbetween of a customerservice

Even better would be that the user can sign-up and complete registration at the FitLife gym on site without the need for contact with the customerservice. This would require payment options, databases, security while doing the payment and probably steps I can not think of as of now. This is also beyond my current knowledge and can therefore not be implemented now. But it would be a must have feature, as it would cut the presure on the customerservice quite a bit and therefore cost.

# Testing

## Navigation

*   ### Intention
    *   A navigationbar that stays on the top of the screen with the user at all times so the user can find the content the user wants quickly and navigate through the website without scrolling if the user wished it so. 
        *   When the screen is smaller, the navigationbar should change to the menu 'burger' button and have a drop down menu when clicked.
    *   Buttons should link to the appropriate sections of the website.
    *   Social media Icons should link to the appropriate website where they stand for and open in a new tab, safely.

*   ### Test
    *   All the links in the navigationbar will be tested if they link to the relevant sections of the website. 
        *   Also on smaller screens when the navigationbar changes to a dropdown menu.
    *   All the buttons will be tested if they link to the appropriate section of the website.
    *   All the social media icons will be tested if they link to the appropriate social media site.

*   ### Result
    *   All links in the navigationbar and buttons go to the appropriate sections of the website.
    *   The dropdown menu will appear if the screen width is smaller then 992px, as intented. 
    *   In the dropdown menu all links work as intented.
    *   On smaller screens, such as a mobile phone, the  the navigation dropdown menu covers half of the screen.
    *   Sectionheaders are not visible when using the navigation bar; they are hidden behind the navigation bar.

*   ### Bugs
    *   Dropdown menu covers half the screen on smaller screen devices.
    *   Sectionheaders are not visible on first glance when user navigates the website with the navigation bar.

*   ### Comments
    *   In current form, there is no login functionality, therefore that link goes back to the top.
    *   In current form, there is no dedicated gallery page, therefore that link goes back to the top.

## Responsiveness

*   ### Intention
    *   The site should be viewable on all standard device screen sizes and should move elements to fit the screen size.
   
*   ### Test
    *   The site will be looked at via the inspection tool of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge in a responsive manner and via the integrated viewports: iPhone 5 SE, iPhone 6/7/8, Nexus 5X, Nexus 10, iPad pro and on a 1080p desktop monitor.
    *   Every section will be looked at seperately.
    *   The site will be looked at via a Sony XZ smart phone.
    
*   ### Result
    *   In the subscription section, the third subscription card does not center on medium width devices.
    *   In the form section, the form jumbotron extends into the subscription section when the width of the screen is over 576px but the height is below 636px.
    *   The rest of the website behaves as expected per bootstrap layout grid.

*   ### Bugs
    *   The 'subscription cards' in the subscription section, do not center as intended.
    *   The form jumbotron extends into the subscription section when width is greater than 576px and height smallen than 636px.

*   ### Comments
    *   None.

## Sign-up Form

*   ### Intention
    *   The sign-up form should recognize when one field or option is not filled in and if that is the case, not submit.
    *   The sign-up form should when all fields and options are filled in, submit to a Code Institute 'correctly submitted form checker' site.
   
*   ### Test
    *   The form will be submitted without any content filled in.
    *   The form will be submitted with some fields or one not filled in, for all fields and options.
    *   The form will be subbmitted when all fields are filled in.
    *   The fields will be tested on correct information in the appropriate field.
    
*   ### Result
    *   When the form had no content filled, it would not submit.
    *   When the form had only one empty field, it would submit without the email and phone number.
    *   When all fields were filled in, with the correct data, it would submit and show the Code Institute 'correctly submitted form checker' site.

*   ### Bugs
    *   The form should not submit without a phonenumber and emailaddress present in the form.

*   ### Comments
    *   The submitted result does not need to be opened in a new tab, as the goal of signing up has been achieved. There is no necessity that user stays on the website.
    *   Ofcourse, instead of going to the website of the Code Institute, there should be a modal in place to say to tell the user that the form has been submitted correctly. See future features.

# Credits

## Overall

I have looked at several websites of gyms and sports for initial inspiration: 

*   [FitForFree](https://www.fitforfree.nl/ "Link to sport site FitForFree")
*   [BasicFit](https://www.basic-fit.com/nl-nl "Link to sport site BasicFit")
*   [Westwood](https://westwood.ie/ "Link to sport site Westwood")

All three have a different approach and I tried to stand apart from them aswell.

## Content

The information on the About-section is roughly based on these articles: [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-benefits-of-exercise#TOC_TITLE_HDR_2 "Healthline.com")  and [Psychologytoday](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201205/18-reasons-exercise "Psychologytoday.com"). That combined with my own and common knowledge.

## Images

All the images present on this website are from [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/ "Unsplash.com") and [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/ "Pexels.com"). Both sites have collections of free to use images and a lot of them are of a very good quality.

## Code

### Overall

The lessons from the Code Institute, the site W3schools and the Stackoverflow forums were of great help in explaining in how certain code should work.

### Form

The code in the sign-up form is based on the form of the 'Love Running' course of Code Institute, although heavily modified. I have used the formdump site as action, so you can see that the form is correctly submitted.

## Thanks

### My mentor

My mentor [Simen Daehlin](https://github.com/Eventyret "githubpage of Simen") for pointing me in the right direction in terms of the goals of the site. He also gave me quite a couple of pointers on how to improve my code and order of code. I am certain that this will make me a more professional coder in the long run.

### My family and friends

I would like to thank my family and friends for their brutally honest feedback which helped a lot to view the website from the users perspective. They did not shy away from pointing out any flaws that I had overlooked.
